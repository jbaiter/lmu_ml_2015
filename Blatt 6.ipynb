    "Consider this – rather pathological – example to illustrate the difference between frequentist and bayesian statistics: Alice and Bob play a game in which the first person to get 6 points wins. The points are scored in the following way: A referee is standing at a pool table Alice and Bob cannot see. Before the game begins, the referee rolls a ball onto the table coming to rest at a random position. Each point scored is decided by the referee rolling another ball. If the ball comes to rest left of (the middle of) the initial ball, Alice scores, if it comes to rest right, Bob scores. The players know nothing but who scored a point. If the portion left of the initial ball is denoted as $p$, it is obvious that the probability of Alice scoring a point is $p$.\n",
